# Pothole-Detection-System
Potholes are an unavoidable obstacle that all motorists in India face, once the
rains have begun which carry on growing day by day. Unfortunately, there is no
system to pin point the exact location of potholes, moreover fixing them is labor
intensive and expensive, and hence system that will detect the potholes and other
irregularities using a deep learning-based model that can detect potholes early
using images and videos which can reduce the chances of an accident. This model
is basically based on Transfer Learning, Faster Region-based Convolutional
Neural Network(F-RCNN) and Inception-V2. There are many models for pothole
detection that uses the accelerometer (without using images and videos) with
machine learning techniques, but a smaller number of pothole detection models
can be found which uses only machine learning techniques to detect potholes. The
results of this work have shown that our proposed model out performs other
existing techniques of potholes detection.

The above Describes Potholes on the road are seen in the above image. The user's input is what we're looking for That pothole can be absorbed here. Here, 0 denotes no potholes and 1 denotes 100% pothole detection.
